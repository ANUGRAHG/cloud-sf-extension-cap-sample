# Setup of a SAP Cloud Platform Account using Boosters

## Introduction

For running the SuccessFactors extension mission you will need the following services in your SAP Cloud Platform account.

* SAP Business Application Studio
* SAP Enterprise Messaging
* SAP Enterprise Messaging Hub
* SAP Application Runtime
* SAP HANA Cloud Service
* SAP Portal / SAP Launchpad
* SAP Continuous Integration & Delivery Service (optional)

The entitlement differs for the pricing option of your account:

**Consumption-based SAP Cloud Platform Account:** 
No entitlement necessary. Be sure that you have enough credits to run the services.

**Subscription-based SAP Cloud Platform Account:** 
You have to create entitlements for the services above - [see also Entitlements and Quotas](https://help.sap.com/viewer/df50977d8bfa4c9a8a063ddb37113c43/Cloud/en-US/38ecf59cdda64150a102cfaa62d5faab.html#loio363f0f68f9704830ac65c87a2562559b).


[Check the costs with the SAP Cloud Platform Estimator Tool](https://www.sap.com/products/cloud-platform/pricing/estimator-tool.html?blueprintId=a0ad3bc5-4fcb-4008-b109-bd8f70634d6c)


**Booster:**

The setup could be done for each service individually. To simplify the setup process, SAP has introduced Boosters. Boosters are a collection of wizards that provides functionalities for specific scenarios to automate and speed-up the installation and configuration process of a SAP Cloud Platform sub-account. This also includes the user management with the mapping of the respective administrator and developer roles.

Before running the booster please check for which regions and infrastructures the services are available - [see SAP Cloud Platform Regions and Service Portfolio ](https://help.sap.com/doc/aa1ccd10da6c4337aa737df2ead1855b/Cloud/en-US/3b642f68227b4b1398d2ce1a5351389a.html) - unfortunately the booster is not able to check this in advance, so it will fail when you select a region where a service is not available.
